Algorithm questions, usually given a real problem, and you need to figure out an optimal solution, and code it up - it is usually not bounded to any programming language.

### How to prepare
You should mimic the real interview scenario as much as possible:
* Do practice e on paper - interview are usually done on paper or whiteboard, not computer.
* Do it within a limited time, like 15 minutes, or 20 minutes - as a real interview is usually time bounded, and you maybe nervous..
* Get your hands on with following coding tactics
* Try real interviews for your non-favorite position first - the experience would be very valuable.

### Common coding tatics 
There are some useful tactics you need to be familiar with, they are very commonly used when you solve coding problems - they are patterns, they are building blocks
* Operate pointers in an array
  * Remove a char from a string (O(n))
  * Remove all duplicated chars from a string (O(n))
* Operate pointers in a list - it is always useful to maintain `pre, cur, next` pointers when you solve certain problems
* Operate index in an array - rotate: (start + 1) % 5; (start + 4) % 5;  binary search
* recursive (how to recursive, when recursion ends?) - it could solve a lot of tree/binary related problem, although at the very first, it is not that clear.
* iterative(loop)
* stack (isvalid('()[]{}')
* queue (BFS, traverse a tree by level)
* list: reverse a single linked list
* tree: LCT, traverse
* graph: DFS, BFS(queue), adjcent list, adjcent matrix

### Algorithm design
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy

### Interview tips
* Think through your solution, ask confirm questions, and dicuss it before rushing to code
* Draw some diagram to help you better analyze the solution, which could also be used to explain your idea to interviewer.
* Finish the main workflow first, and then check the edge case.
* Write your code with large interval - so you could insert code late when you see bugs
* Put `{` at the end of the previous line, rather than on a new line - you don't have enough space, like:
 ```
 for(auto& s: sets) {
     s.erase(val)
 }
 ```
