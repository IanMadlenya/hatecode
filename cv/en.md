## Experience
---
### Vice President, Morgan Stanley, 2011.7 – present
As a lead developer to build an enterprise-level CI/CD system, I am also the manager of build systems for all different programming languages.

### Software Engineer, Autodesk, 2005.3 – 2011.7
Build 3D CAD software and CAD data format exchange platform.

## Projects
---
### Train, 2011.7 – present
Train is an enterprise-level CI/CD system that enable deploying user’s project from source code all the way through to the target environment by one click.  It integrate existing commercial and open source systems, including Perforce, Git, Jira, Crucible, premake, ant, gradle, Jenkins, and Team City. Provides the internal development community with a consistent process for developing and deploying software, while also making it easy to adopt best practices. **I am a lead developer of Train responsible for many of the components, highly involved in user discussion, cross-team collaboration, and design reviews to ensure the system is evolving on the right** direction.

### MSPremake, 2012.5 – present
This is a fork of the open source C++ meta build system premake, based on lua, to provide better C++ build story for Morgan Stanley with: dependency management and conflict resolution, performance improvement using luajit, optimal makefile generation, distributed build support etc. **I am the owner and lead developer of the project, involve in all aspects of the project: user discussion, design, coding, testing, documentation, deploy, training, support etc.**

### MSGradle , 2013.10 – present
This is an extension of the open source java/scala build system gradle, based on groovy, to provide better java/scala build story for Morgan Stanley with a lot of plugins: run script generation, dependency resolvers, dependency copy etc. **I am the owner and lead developer of the project, involve in all aspects of the project: user discussion, design, coding, testing, documentation, deploy, training, support etc.**

### Autodesk Translator Platform, 2010.12 – 2011.7
This was a new initiative to renovate the way how different CAD data format are exchanged, the purpose is to provide a central service to exchange between any data format, which could then be used by all Autodesk CAD products. **I was one of the initiator, as well as tech leader of the SH local team of 10+, working with senior architects on defining scope and overall design**, I also participated in almost every aspects of the design: overall architecture, interface hierarchy, parallel processing, memory management, option design, and error report

### Inventor OEM, 2010.3 – 2010.11
Inventor OEM was a new product that allows CAD developers to rebrand Autodesk Inventor and create domain specific workflows from Inventor functionalities. The project aims at de-coupling Inventor components from each other so that various combinations of them can form self-contained systems; a side goal was to improve its startup time. **I was the scrum master, and then lead of the team, overseeing the team operation, the quality of the team’s work and cross-team collaborations. **

### Inventor Refactoring, 2008.8 – 2010.2 
The refactoring separated Inventor into two layers: the data model and the UI, and wraps the data model up as a standalone component, to provide other products ability to inter-operate with Inventor. **I was the scrum master as well as core developer, I wrote many tools to automate the refactoring, setup up the testing framework for the new data model part, during when I also drove the effort to standardize header file including rule(followed by 200+ developers), optimize build time(by %5)**

### Inventor AddIn Framework For Manufacturing, 2008.1 – 2008.7
This was an addin framework served as the foundation of several Inventor plugin for mould and die design. **I was the tech leader of this 8-member core team, designed and implemented the initial logical and physical architecture.**

### Inventor AIP, 2006.3 – 2007.12
Inventor AIP was a product that provides Cable & Harness design for end users, as a core developer I added a new cable type, optimized the cable routing algorithm, and also improved the performance of the entire system by ~30%.

### Inventor Measure Tools, 2005.12 – 2006.5
This is an integrated measure tool in Inventor to measure geometric metrics like: minimum distance, length, area, volume, angle etc. **I was the tech leader of 3, design, implement and oversee the quality of the deliverable.**

### Inventor Surface Analysis, 2005.3 – 2005.11
As a new developer, I developed 2 features for Inventor’s surface analysis functionality: curvature analysis and 3d intersection.
