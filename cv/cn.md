### 工作经历
---
#### Vice President, 摩根士丹利, 2011.7 – 至今
作为lead developer开发一个企业级CI/CD系统，同时管理build systems团队

#### Software Engineer, 欧特克软件, 2005.3 – 2011.7
开发大型三维设计软件，以及CAD数据格式转换平台

### 项目经验
---
#### Train, 2011.7 – present
Train是一个大型企业级CI/CD系统，其主要目的为帮助用户将其项目自动化部署到测试或者生产环境；Train集成了各种商业或者开源软件，并将其组织成一套完成的自动化部署流程，包括P4, Git, Jira, Crucible, premake, gradle, jenkins, teamcity等等，为公司内部所有的开发团队提供一个统一的开发，部署系统，并推荐最佳实践。 **我作为lead developer负责开发了多个组件，并负责用户讨论，跨团队合作，以及设计评审来保证系统向正确的方向发展**

#### MSPremake, 2012.5 – present
MSPremake基于开源C++元编译工具premake开发，使用C和lua，旨在为摩根士丹利大型C++项目提供更完善的编译体验，其核心功能为：依赖管理和版本冲突处理；并添加了其他功能：使用luajit提升运行速度；高性能的makefile生成器；cmake,eclipse生成器； 集成distcc并行编译等等。**作为项目的owner和主要开发者，我参与了项目的所有方面：用户讨论，功能设计，编码，测试，部署，文档，培训，用户支持等等**

#### MSGradle , 2013.10 – present
MSGradle基于开发java/scala编译工具gradle开发，使用groovy，旨在为摩根士丹利提供一个更强大、灵活的java编译工具 - 我们主要通过开发plugin的方式来提供功能，但也有时需要直接patch gradle； 提供的功能有：runscript生成器, dependency resolver, dependency cache等等; **作为项目的owner和主要开发者，我参与了项目的所有方面：用户讨论，功能设计，编码，测试，部署，文档，培训，用户支持等等**

#### Autodesk Translator Platform, 2010.12 – 2011.7
This was a new initiative to renovate the way how different CAD data format are exchanged, the purpose is to provide a central service to exchange between any data format, which could then be used by all Autodesk CAD products. **I was one of the initiator, as well as tech leader of the SH local team of 10+, working with senior architects on defining scope and overall design**, I also participated in almost every aspects of the design: overall architecture, interface hierarchy, parallel processing, memory management, option design, and error report

#### Inventor OEM, 2010.3 – 2010.11
Inventor OEM was a new product that allows CAD developers to rebrand Autodesk Inventor and create domain specific workflows from Inventor functionalities. The project aims at de-coupling Inventor components from each other so that various combinations of them can form self-contained systems; a side goal was to improve its startup time. **I was the scrum master, and then lead of the team, overseeing the team operation, the quality of the team’s work and cross-team collaborations. **

#### Inventor Refactoring, 2008.8 – 2010.2 
The refactoring separated Inventor into two layers: the data model and the UI, and wraps the data model up as a standalone component, to provide other products ability to inter-operate with Inventor. **I was the scrum master as well as core developer, I wrote many tools to automate the refactoring, setup up the testing framework for the new data model part, during when I also drove the effort to standardize header file including rule(followed by 200+ developers), optimize build time(by %5)**

#### Inventor AddIn Framework For Manufacturing, 2008.1 – 2008.7
This was an addin framework served as the foundation of several Inventor plugin for mould and die design. **I was the tech leader of this 8-member core team, designed and implemented the initial logical and physical architecture.**

#### Inventor AIP, 2006.3 – 2007.12
Inventor AIP was a product that provides Cable & Harness design for end users, as a core developer I added a new cable type, optimized the cable routing algorithm, and also improved the performance of the entire system by ~30%.

#### Inventor Measure Tools, 2005.12 – 2006.5
This is an integrated measure tool in Inventor to measure geometric metrics like: minimum distance, length, area, volume, angle etc. **I was the tech leader of 3, design, implement and oversee the quality of the deliverable.**

#### Inventor Surface Analysis, 2005.3 – 2005.11
作为第一个项目，我为Inventor曲面分析开发了两个功能：曲率分析和三维曲面交叉线生成
