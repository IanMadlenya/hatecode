Hmm, I hate interviews, or probably be more accurate - I hate to be interviewed:) but I guess interview is unavoidable for your to find someone talented, and for you to find a job you like. So, let's do it to have a high quality interview.

The general process on interviewing is:
* Resume Screen - Don't bring anyone in, there should be some hard requirement (language, experience, smart etc)
* Phone Interview - quickly(30m) go through a list of questions, mainly to weed out people who only do cheap 'talks',  no need to be intensive
* Onsite interview (or, sadly, still phone interview :( ) - get personal, go deep, have a plan (talk - language - coding)
One tip is to always leave time for questions

And Here hatecode just resembles leetcode:)
