Hmm...
How to interview a CTO, or interview for a CTO? That is something worth considering, and learning.

Here are the topics I think might be important:
* Lead the techinical direction
* Hire talented techinical people
* Build teams (dev/qa...)
* Build process (SDLC, CI, CD...)
* Networking - relationship is key to make things happen
