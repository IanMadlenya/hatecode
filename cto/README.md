Hmm...
How to interview a CTO, or interview for a CTO? That is something worth considering, and learning.

Here are the topics I think might be important:
* Lead the techinical direction
* Hire talented techinical people
* Build teams (dev/qa...)
* Build process (SDLC, CI, CD...)
* Networking - relationship is key to make things happen

### Leadership
* What is your [leadership style](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/mw1024/6275ea6agw1f5rxjasf8qj20jg0d2jw5.jpg)? (pacesetting, coaching)
* How do you think your direct reports think of you? (role model; learn from; control too much...)

### Books
* 《影响力》
* 《The Five Dysfunctions of a Team》
